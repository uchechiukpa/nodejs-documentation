# IDE for Node.js

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development. When you're working with Node.js, it's important to have a good IDE that supports JavaScript and offers features that enhance productivity, such as syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, debugging tools, and an integrated terminal.

Here are some popular IDEs suitable for Node.js development:

### **Visual Studio Code**

Visual Studio Code (often abbreviated as VS Code) is a popular, lightweight, and powerful source code editor developed by Microsoft. It has built-in support for Node.js development and JavaScript, along with features like:

* Debugging: VS Code comes with robust debugging support, perfect for Node.js applications.
* Extension Marketplace: VS Code has a vast marketplace of extensions to provide additional languages, themes, debuggers, commands, and more.
* Integrated Terminal: You can run your Node.js application right from the built-in terminal.
