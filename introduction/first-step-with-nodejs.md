# First Step

### **Step 1: Installation**

Before you start using Node.js, you need to install it on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Node.js website at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system. You'll see options for Windows, macOS, and Linux. If you're a beginner, it's recommended to download the LTS (Long Term Support) version because it's more stable.
3. Once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the prompts in the Node.js Setup Wizard.

Congratulations, you now have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer!

### **Step 2: Verify Installation**

Let's verify that Node.js and npm were correctly installed:

1. Open your command line tool (Terminal on macOS/Linux, Command Prompt, or PowerShell on Windows).
2. To check if Node.js is installed, type the following command and hit enter:\
   &#x20;node -v\
   This command should display the installed version of Node.js.
3. To check if npm is installed, type the following command and hit enter:\
   npm -v\
   This command should display the installed version of npm.
4.  If you see the versions, congratulations! You've successfully installed Node.js and npm.



### **Step 3: Your First Node.js Script**

Now, let's write a simple Node.js script:

1. Open your favorite text editor or IDE.
2. Create a new file named `app.js`.
3. Write or paste the following JavaScript code into your `app.js` file:\
   console.log('Hello, Node.js!');
4. Save the file and close your text editor.

### **Step 4: Running Your Node.js Script**

1. Go back to your command line tool. Navigate to the directory where your `app.js` file is located using the `cd` (change directory) command. For example:\
   cd /path/to/your/file
2. Now, let's run the file with Node.js. Type the following command and hit enter:\
   node app.js.\
   You should see `Hello, Node.js!` printed in the console.

And there you have it! You've just installed Node.js, verified the installation, and ran your first Node.js script. If you were able to follow these steps without any issues, you're well on your way to developing applications with Node.js.

In the next sections, we'll dive deeper into the various features and capabilities that Node.js provides.
